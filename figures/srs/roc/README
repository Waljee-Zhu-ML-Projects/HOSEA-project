File name structure:

<Cancer Type>
_<Subset by missingness>
[_<Whether it is representative>]
.<File type>

In particular:
- Cancer type: 
  - ANY, EAC, EGJAC determine which model is used 
  - subsetting the test set by removing cases that are inappropriate (e.g., EAC model removes EGJAC cases)
- Subset by missingness: 
  - all: everything is used
  - complete: only patients with complete records wrt HUNT, Kunzmann, etc.
  - incomplete: all\complete
- Representative:
  - If present, then the test set downsamples males and adjusts cases proportion to 8.33:1
  - If absent, then the original test set is used without subsampling
